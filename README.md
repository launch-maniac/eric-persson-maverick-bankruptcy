- **Court:** U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston Division)
- **Judge:** Honorable Alfredo R. Perez
- **Administration:** Jointly administered cases
- **Total Debtors:** 68 entities (see complete list in Appendix)

### Business Operations

- **Colorado:** Casino operations (Z Casino properties in Black Hawk and Central City)
- **Transportation:** Charter bus operations
- **Signage Business:** Gaming signage and design services
- **Intellectual Property:** Various gaming-related IP rights

### Restructuring Strategy
**Initial Structure:** Restructuring Support Agreement (RSA) with:
- Lender group
- Majority shareholder/former CEO

**Original Plan:** Two-part asset sale process

---

## Asset Categories

### 1. PokerCo Assets (COMPLETED)
- **Description:** Card rooms in Washington State
- **Process:** Auction held with former CEO as stalking horse bidder
- **Status:**
  - Winning bidder selected
  - Backup bidder identified
  - Court approval obtained
  - Moving toward closing
  - Shareholder services agreement approved (October 23, 2025)

### 2. MainCo Assets (IN PROGRESS)
**Components:**
- Casinos in Nevada
- Casinos in Colorado
- Debtor's signage business
- Certain IP rights

**Original Plan:** Single marketing/sales process with lender credit bid option or debt-to-equity swap via Chapter 11 plan

**Current Reality:** Case has "changed significantly"
- Received bids on nearly a dozen different asset subsets
- Now negotiating with ~6 different buyers
- Piecemeal sales instead of single transaction
- Credit bid on subset of MainCo assets
- Two auctions already conducted
- One sale hearing completed
- 1-2 additional sale hearings anticipated (early-to-mid November)

**Key Filings:**
- Docket #603: Notice of successful bidders
- Docket #469: Additional successful bidders
- Docket #617: Stipulation for treatment of certain assets

---

## Ongoing Negotiations

### Blue Owl Landlord Issue
- Major landlord dispute
- Related to certain properties
- Motion to assume master lease (separate from Angela Gordon lease)
- Still being negotiated
- Hopeful for resolution

### UCC Resolution Discussions
- Ongoing conversations between:
  - Unsecured Creditors Committee (UCC)
  - Lenders
  - States
- May delay credit bid sale hearing timing
- Committee considering challenge to lenders' credit bid ability if no resolution

---

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Cash Flow Impact from Piecemeal Sales
**Problem:**
- When individual operations sell and close, estate loses those ongoing operational cash flows
- Estate still incurs administrative expenses while operating remaining assets
- Must maintain adequate reserves for administrative solvency post-closing

**Solution:**
- Sale proceeds must be held in estate with adequate provisions
- Will be reflected in sale orders submitted for court approval

### 2. Professional Fee Budget Overages
**Original Budget Assumptions:**
- Two-sale process
- Single auction, single sale hearing
- Completion by end of September 2025
- Sales ready to close by October 2, 2025 (pending regulatory approval)
- Significant drop-off in professional fees anticipated in early October

**Current Reality:**
- Multiple piecemeal sales = expanded scope
- Professional fees have "increased significantly"
- Identified as concern for "many weeks"
- Hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars over budget
- Example: Latham & Watkins has exceeded entire case budget amount

**Negotiations:**
- **Go-Forward Funding:** Tentative agreement reached with lenders based on current case assumptions (still documenting details)
- **Existing Overages:** NO agreement reached on fees incurred to date
- Lenders may object to professional fees at interim fee stage
- Debtor's position: Fees reflect "necessary and efficient work" with proper allocation among advisors

**Lender Concerns (per Daniel Gwen, Ropes & Gray):**
- Overstaffing
- Inefficiencies
- Cash crunch - funding is "particularly tight"
- Reserve right to object at final fee hearing

---

## Court Directives

**Judge's Instructions:**
- No action required at status conference
- Continue working toward resolution
- Reserve November 7, 2025 for sale hearing(s)
- Be aware of limited December availability

**Debtor's Next Steps:**
1. Finalize go-forward funding documentation with lenders
2. Continue fee dispute resolution efforts
3. Coordinate with UCC/lenders/states on global settlement
4. Schedule sale hearing dates with court
5. Prepare sale orders reflecting administrative solvency provisions
6. Be prepared to defend professional fees if objections filed

---

## Key Quotes

**Helena Erguas (Debtor's Counsel):**
> "The case has changed significantly since then. It has expanded in scope since the filing date."

> "We need to account for appropriate reserves to ensure that the estates are left administratively solvent post closing and pending the conclusion of the cases."

> "We're confident that our fees on this banner reflect necessary and efficient work."

**Committee Counsel:**
> "If we can't get [to resolution]... we may be back before Your Honor seeking to prosecute the committee's challenge, which would, I think by definition include a challenge to the lender's ability to credit bid, which I think would be a very different track for these cases."

**Daniel Gwen (Lenders' Counsel):**
> "We'll be the first to admit that this case hasn't gone exactly the way that we all envisioned it at the start of the case."

> "The professionals have exceeded their budgeted amount by hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars through this period of time."

## Risk Factors

1. **Administrative Insolvency:** If reserves inadequate or fees continue to exceed funding
2. **Credit Bid Challenge:** UCC may challenge lenders' ability to credit bid (significant case disruption)
3. **Fee Litigation:** Interim and/or final fee objections by lenders
4. **Timeline Pressure:** Limited court availability in November/December
5. **Multi-Party Negotiation Complexity:** Debtor, lenders, UCC, states, multiple buyers

---

## Analysis & Observations

**Case Complexity Has Multiplied:**
- From 2 asset categories → ~12 different asset subsets
- From 2 buyers → ~6 different buyers
- From 1 auction → 2+ auctions (more likely)
- From 1 sale hearing → 3+ sale hearings

**Cash Management Critical:**
- Piecemeal sales create unique challenge: proceeds arrive but operational cash flows disappear
- Must balance maximizing value vs. maintaining operational viability during wind-down
- Administrative solvency is real concern (mentioned multiple times)

**Professional Fee Dispute Signals Tension:**
- Lenders providing DIP financing feel budgets were significantly exceeded
- Debtors argue scope change justifies increased fees
- Classic bankruptcy tension: who bears cost of case complexity?
- May require court intervention if parties can't resolve

**UCC Has Leverage:**
- Credit bid challenge would fundamentally change case trajectory
- Committee using this as negotiating leverage for "global resolution"
- Suggests unsecured creditors may not be receiving meaningful recovery under current structure

**Judge's Availability Constraint:**
- November 7 is critical window
- Late November/December severely limited
- Puts pressure on parties to get sale hearings scheduled soon or face delays into 2026
